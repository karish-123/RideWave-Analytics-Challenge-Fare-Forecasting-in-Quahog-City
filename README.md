# RideWave Analytics Challenge: Fare Forecasting in Quahog City

##  Project Overview

This project is part of the Data Analytics Hackathon, focusing on fare forecasting for RideWave, a ride-sharing service operating in Quahog City. The challenge involves analyzing historical fare data and building predictive models to forecast average fares for different vehicle types.

##  Project Objectives

The main objectives of this analytics challenge are:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct comprehensive analysis to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in fare data for each vehicle type (bikes, autos, and cars) in Quahog City.

2. **Time Series Analysis**: Examine the time series characteristics of average fare data and implement appropriate forecasting models.

3. **Forecasting Models**: Implement Holt's Linear Trend Model and Holt-Winters Seasonal Model to predict future average fares.

4. **Business Insights**: Provide actionable insights for RideWave's business operations based on the analysis.

## üìÅ Dataset Information

### Data Sources
- **Training Data**: `train.csv` - Historical fare data with 63,015 records
- **Test Data**: `test.csv` - Data for making predictions
- **Sample Submission**: `sample_submission.csv` - Template for submission format

### Features
The dataset contains the following key features:

| Feature | Description | Data Type |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| `timestamp` | Date and time of the record | datetime |
| `average_fare` | Average fare amount (target variable) | float64 |
| `rides_completed` | Number of rides completed | int64 |
| `driver_availability` | Driver availability metric | float64 |
| `surge_multiplier` | Dynamic pricing multiplier | float64 |
| `vehicle_type` | Type of vehicle (bike, auto, car) | object |
| `traffic_index` | Traffic congestion index | int64 |
| `special_event` | Binary indicator for special events | int64 |
| `weather_Clear` | Weather condition indicator | int64 |

### Vehicle Types
- **Bikes**: Two-wheeled vehicles
- **Autos**: Three-wheeled vehicles  
- **Cars**: Four-wheeled vehicles

## üîç Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Converted timestamp to datetime format
- Sorted data chronologically for time series analysis
- Handled missing values and outliers
- Applied log transformation to normalize average_fare data

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Time Series Visualization**: Analyzed fare trends over time for each vehicle type
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted stationarity tests using Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
- **Feature Analysis**: Examined relationships between features and average fare
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified and analyzed outliers in key features

### 3. Time Series Modeling
- **Holt's Linear Trend Model**: Applied for trend-based forecasting
- **Holt-Winters Seasonal Model**: Implemented for seasonal pattern forecasting
- **Model Evaluation**: Compared forecast accuracy and performance

### 4. Machine Learning Approach
- **XGBoost Regression**: Used for advanced predictive modeling
- **Feature Engineering**: Created time-based features and transformations
- **Cross-validation**: Ensured robust model performance

## üìà Key Findings

### Fare Trends by Vehicle Type
- **Cars**: Showed increasing linear trend over time
- **Bikes**: Exhibited increasing linear trend over time  
- **Autos**: Displayed relatively constant fare over time

### Stationarity Analysis
- Average fare data was found to be non-stationary
- Log transformation was applied to improve model performance
- Seasonal patterns were identified in the time series data

### Business Insights
- Different vehicle types show distinct fare patterns
- Seasonal and trend components significantly influence fare predictions
- Driver availability and traffic conditions impact fare dynamics
